			Missy Midwest is a technically trained music artist & DJ hailing from Central Illinois. She
			graduated with her Bachelors Degree in Public Relations & Business Administration in 2015 and
			decided to go back to school for music in 2016. She earned her Associates Degree in 2019 with
			a focus in piano & voice from the highly regarded music program at Illinois Central College.
			<br /><br />
			When the pandemic arrived at America's doorstep, Missy lost her job due to restaurant closures
			and was forced to look within for a more stable & desired reality.
			<br /><br />
			As a self-taught DJ & educated business woman, she landed her first DJ gig in 2021 and has been
			rollercoasting through her career at a high speed.
			<br /><br />
			Her song choice, smooth mixing, hot cue play, & dominant feminine energy has gathered her a humble
			following throughout her tour of the Southern Midwest. She combines booty bouncing hip-hop tracks
			with sub bass you can feel.
			<br /><br />
			You can find her making a splash at festivals such as Dancefestopia (Kansas City), Backwoods at
			Mulberry Mountain (AR), Breakaway (KC), Creepshow (KC) as well as your favorite party coves across
			the Lake of the Ozarks.
