Missy Midwest is a “Midwest grown” music artist & DJ hailing from Central Illinois. Her song choice, stage presence, smooth mixing & dominant feminine energy has gathered her a humble following throughout her tour of the Southern Midwest. Missy combines the most relevant tracks of the day with booty bouncing beats & sub bass you can feel. You can find her making a splash in Lake of the Ozarks this summer as she simultaneously hones her craft in Ableton.
